## How to run WoLF

You can run WoLF by installing the debian packages on your computer or with a docker container. To clone this repository run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/graiola/wolf-setup.git`

### Docker container for Ubuntu 16.04 - 18.04 - 20.04

To download the image from [docker-hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/serger87/wolf-app) and launch WoLF within a docker container, run the following script:

`./run_docker.sh`

You can see what are the available options in the script with the following command:

`./run_docker.sh --help`

In case you don't have docker installed on your computer, you can run the following script:

`./support/install_docker.sh`

This script will install docker and its dependencies.

#### Demos:

We prepared some demos to run directly within the docker container:

- `./demos/2d_navigation.sh` : Run an indoor 2D navigation demo 
- `./demos/3d_navigation.sh` : Run an outdoor 3D navigation demo
- `./demos/manipulation.sh` : Run spot with a kinova arm mounted on top
- `./demos/locomotion.sh` : Run a demo with stairs

#### Notes:

- It could be necessary to restart the computer after running `install_docker.sh`.
- Use the `install_nvidia.sh` script in the `support` folder  if you are experiencing the following problem: `could not select device driver "" with capabilities: [[gpu]]`. 
- If you are experiencing this problem `nvidia-container-cli initialization error nvml error driver not loaded`, it probably means that your computer does not have the latest nvidia-drivers installed, so be sure that they are installed and updated to the last version.

### System installation for Ubuntu 20.04

To install the required dependencies (including ROS) and the WoLF debian packages run the following:

`./install.sh`

After the installation, update your bash enviroment with the following command:

`source ~/.bashrc`

#### How to start the controller

WoLF provides four interfaces to move the robot:

- A [PS3](docs/ps3.png) joypad interface: `roslaunch wolf_controller wolf_controller_bringup.launch input_device:=ps3`
- A [XBox](docs/xbox.jpeg) joypad interface: `roslaunch wolf_controller wolf_controller_bringup.launch input_device:=xbox`
- A [keyboard](docs/keyboard.png) interface: `roslaunch wolf_controller wolf_controller_bringup.launch input_device:=keyboard`
- A [spacemouse](docs/spacemouse.pdf) interface: `roslaunch wolf_controller wolf_controller_bringup.launch input_device:=spacemouse`

A twist topic is always active and listening for velocity commands on `/robot_name/wolf_controller/twist`. This topic can be used to send twist commands at a lower priority than the above mentioned interfaces.
It can also be used to send `move_base` commands if you want  to integrate WoLF with the ROS navigation stack (see [wolf_navigation](https://github.com/graiola/wolf_navigation) for an example).
To make the robot stand up, press the `start` button on the joypad or press the `enter` key if you are using the keyboard.
